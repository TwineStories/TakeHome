# Twine Take Home Task

Hello, thank you for your interest in Twine, we're excited to see what you can do!

## The Task

Your task is to create a navigation bar component for our website. The navigation bar should be responsive and work on different screen resolutions. The following files have been provided for your convenience: 

- 'Navbar.tsx' - The component file, you can use this to create your component
- '/images/' - A folder containing the images you will need to complete the task
- '/fonts/' - A folder containing the fonts you will need to complete the task
- '/example/Navbar.png' - An example of what the component should look like when complete

Feel free to create any additional files you need to complete the task. Additionally, you may import any packages you wish to use.

## Bonus Task

If you have time, you can also complete the bonus task. The bonus task is to create a mobile compatible version of the navigation bar that uses a hamburger menu. As there is no example for this, you can use your own creativity to decide how this should look.
